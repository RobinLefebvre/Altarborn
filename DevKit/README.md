# Altarborn - DevKit
Repository for the Altarborn DevKit. The DevKit holds applications, webservices or other utility files for producing the Altarborn content.
The idea is to drop several sub-folders on here, each containing a specific tool that people could use to work on the game's data, or tools to speed up the development process and content-making.

The DevKit will double as utility file and documentation storage.

Currently it holds : 
- PostMan utility file for API testing.
